# Notebooks for Learning Bayesian Statistics

This repository contains notebooks and code demonstrating key concepts in Bayesian statistics, especially concerning Bayesian computation. Much of the mterial is based off the book *Bayesian Data Analysis* by Gelman, et. al. (2004)

## Table of Contents

1. [Notebooks Overview](#notebooks-overview)

## Notebooks Overview

List and briefly describe each notebook included in the repository. Provide a summary of the content covered in each notebook and any relevant information about the datasets or analyses performed.

1. **sampling.ipynb**: Some basic sampling methods useful for Bayesian computation: rejection sampling, importance sampling, and inverse CDF sampling.
2. **markovchain.ipynb**: Basic implementation of Gibbs sampling and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
